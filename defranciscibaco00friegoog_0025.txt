Ex hac oratione videmus, quod jam in introductione prae-
diximus, Baconi in civitate considerenda eam sententiam
maxime placuisse, quae rempublicam tanquam corpus ex
initiis suis et seminibus nasci et proficere videt. Sic in
oratione:
„The first platform of monarchy is that of a father,
who governing over his wife by prerogative of sex,
over his children by prerogative of age and because
he is author unto thereos being, and over his ser·
vants by prerogative of virtue and providence (for he
that is able of body and improvident of mind is na-
tura servus) that is the very model of a king;“
quo loco Aristotelem Polit. Lib. ΙΙ. cap. IV. laudam).
Viam et rationem, qua homines adducti fuerint, imperio
sese subjicere hoc modo Baco demonstrat:
„The first original submission is paternity or patriarchy,
which waS, when a family growing so great, as it
could not contain itself within on habitation‚ some
branches of the descendants ‘were forced to plant
themselves into new familieS, which second families
could not by a natural instinct and inclination, but
bear a reverence and yield an obeisance to the eldest
line of the ancient family, from which they were de-
rived. -- The second is the admiration of virtue or
gratitude towards merit, which is likewise naturally
infused into all men. Of this Aristotle putteth the case
well, when it was the fortune of some one man, either
to invent some arts of excellent use towards mans
χ life„ or to congregate people thas dwelt scattered into
. one place, where they might cohabit with more com-
