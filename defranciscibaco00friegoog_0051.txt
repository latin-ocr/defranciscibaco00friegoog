76) „Let the rule of justice be the laws of the land, an
impartial arbiter between the king and his people and
between on subject and another.“ „Let no arbitrary
power be intruded. But because the life of the'laws
lies in the due execution and administration of them,
let your eye be in the first place upon the choiee of
good judges; these properties had they need to ,be
furnished with; to be patient in hearing, prudent in
governing, powersul in their elocution to persuade and
satisfy both the parties and the hearers; just in their
judgment; and tho sum up all, they must have these
three attributes ; they must be man os courage fearing
God, and hating covetousness; an ignorant man can-
not; a coward dares not be a good judge.“ -

77) „Judges must be as chaste as Ceasars wife, neither
to be, nor to be suspected to be unjust; the honour
of the judges in their judicature is the kings honour,
whose person they represent.“
