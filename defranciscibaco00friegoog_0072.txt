sapientissimis Baconis consiliis haec civitas opes suas di-
vitiasque refert acceptas. Etiam in hac re Baco bene
consuluit initiis negotiationiS‚ quod commercii summum
moderatorem voluit esse civitatem, ita quidem, ut procu-
ratores qui utilitatibus mercatorum prospicerent, subjecti
sint consilio cuidam summ0‚ quod commodis reipublicae
consulat. Commercium apud Anglos in dies crevit, quod
respublica expeditionibus et itineribus instituendis et in-
numeris legibus prudentissimis et suis et civium suorum
commodis sapientissime consuluit. Illa ratio, qua Baco
libertates mercaturae cum utilitatibus reipublicae con-
junxit, nostris quoque temporibus admodum commen-
danda est

Vll. DE COLONIIS.

1⁰⁷) „Colonies and foreign plantations are very neces-
sary, as outletS, to a populous nation, and may be
profitable also, if they be managed in a discreet way.“
1⁰⁸) „plantationem populorum probo in solo puro: intel-

 

causes ought to be allowed a free operation. It is observed by
Hume, that the statutes of Henry VII relating to the police of his
kingdom are generally contrived with more judgment, than his
commercial regulations. The same writer adds that:“ The more
simple ideas of order and equity are sufficient to guide a legis·
lator in every thing, that regards the intern administration of ju·
stice3 but that the principles of commerce are much more com-
plicated and require long experience and deep reflection to he
well understood in any state. The real consequences is there
often contrary to first appearances3 no wonder that during the
reign of Henry Vll these matters were frequently mistakcn and
may safely be affirmem, that even, in the age of Lord Bacon

very imperfect and erroneous ideas were formed on that subject.“
